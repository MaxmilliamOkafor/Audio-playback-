AUDIO PLAYBACK PROJECT

This Project requires you to design and implement a distributed system to support audio playback over an Internet style network similar to Spotify (https://open.spotify.com). The implemented system must provide an audio playback client and an audio file server, suitable for distribution by replication, that communicate over the network. The client will access and download (or stream) audio files from the server/service and allow them to be played back by the user. You will look at and implement solutions for distributing the load of multiple clients across multiple servers through a distribution mechanism of your choice.

The audio playback client should allow a user to:

•	Connect to a user specified IP address 

•	Retrieve a list of audio files from the service

•	Playback a selected audio file

README FILE WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN PROGRAM!!!!

Instructions in successfully running my Code in the following steps 
 
1: In my Zip file I have provided a Client and Server Folder 
2: Open the Client and Server in Separately in visual studio 
3: Clean and Build just to ensure it runs smoothly  
4: After build, First run the SERVER code 
 
6: Then the client should ask for “USERNAME” and “PASSWORD” which I have provided in the client Folder called “LOGIN DETAILS.txt ”  
  
7: After successfully Logging in it should prompt "Access has been granted"  
With the exact login “username: LOGIN1234” & “password: 1234” or access will be denied 
  
 
8: After this client starts loading the files in the server and in order to retrieve the files you press 
“ENTER” which then successfully Obtains the files from server   
  
9: After files have been obtain simply press “ENTER” to open files
 
  
 
10: After this my program should then ask for another request where you can either insert “Play” (which at the moment it plays my default file “wanna-go-shopping” this can easily be changed in the client and “Stop” command while audio is playing in order to stop.  
 
  
 
   
12: The wav file can be changed in the client program.
